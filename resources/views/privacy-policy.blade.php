															<h5>2. Scope of Policy</h5>
															<div class="custom-one-col-content-col">
																<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> This Policy covers the processing of information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (<strong>“Personal Information”</strong>) gathered by Ethical Research Solutions when you are using the Website and provide insights and opinions when answering our surveys. This Policy also covers Ethical Research Solutions’s processing of any Personal Information that Ethical Research Solutions may share with its business partners or other third parties under very limited circumstances.</p>
																<p><strong>Third Party Services.</strong> This Policy does not apply to the general practices and processing of information (whether personal or not) by third parties that Ethical Research Solutions does not own or control, including but not limited to any third-party websites or services (<strong>“Third-Party Website”</strong> or <strong>“Third-Party Service”</strong>) that you elect to access through the Website or via a link from the Website. While we attempt to facilitate access or link only to those Third-Party Websites or Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third-Party Websites or Third-Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Website you access or Third-Party Service you use.</p>
																<p><strong>Limited Collection.</strong> Ethical Research Solutions does not gather any of your Personal Information while you are using the Website, except as provided in this Policy. Where you have provided Personal Information or where we have collected Personal Information, it will only be used for the stated purpose, as detailed more specifically in the next sections.</p>
																<p><strong>Personal Information collected, purposes and legal basis.</strong> The following is a list of Personal Information that Ethical Research Solutions may collect from you when you use the Website and what we use it for.</p>
																<ul>
																	<li>While visiting the Website, participating in surveys or providing a Testimonial you may be required to provide the following accurate and truthful Personal Information: first name, email address, age, gender, postal code, marital status, primary occupation and household income. You may also choose to provide us with additional Personal Information when you fill out free fields in our questionnaires. These Personal Information are used by Ethical Research Solutions, in the context of the consumer surveys it conducts on behalf of its customers, leading to the establishment and transmission of statistics. Ethical Research Solutions's activities actually consist in conducting surveys on behalf of its client towards a targeted audience. Ethical Research Solutions determines the questions asked, and therefore, some of the Personal Information required, depending on the purpose and nature of the survey in question, as well as on the expected results. The processing of such Personal Information is based on your express consent.</li>
																	<li>When you visit the Website to access the results of a survey, as a customer of Ethical Research Solutions, you provide Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, first and last name. This processing is carried out on the basis of the execution of the contract between you and Ethical Research Solutions.</li>
																	<li>We may also use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you as further described in Section 5 (Mailing List Management). In particular, Ethical Research Solutions may contact you individually following a survey or a Testimonial to provide you with information that may be of interest to you. Such processing is based on your express consent. If you have not consented to the reception of such communications, Ethical Research Solutions will not contact you for this purpose.</li>
																	<li>When visiting the Website, Ethical Research Solutions may collect information through cookies, as further described in Section 9 of this Policy and in the Cookie Policy accessible <a href="cookie-policy.html?hsLang=en">here </a>.</li>

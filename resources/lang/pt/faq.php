Then they respond to specific questions that we established in response to our clients' needs. Finally, we process the data to extract local consumer habits according to each sociodemographic profile, in addition to compiling a comprehensive quantitative overview of the population’s needs.",

For example, on-site surveys always reach participants who are in a lower income bracket than the national average, while phone surveys tend to mainly reach seniors or people who stay at home (remember, the majority of Millennials don’t have a landline!). On the other hand, it is harder to reach the retired population with our social media surveys.",
